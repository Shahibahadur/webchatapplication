Absolute Path vs Relative Path (Short Note)
Absolute Path:

Starts with / and points to the resource from the web server's root or the application context root.
Unaffected by the current file's location.
Example: /ChatAPP/FriendSearchServlet
Use for consistent resource links like servlets or critical files.
Relative Path:

Points to the resource relative to the current file's location.
Can use ../ to go up a directory.
Example: ../FriendSearchServlet
Use for local file references like images or CSS within the same structure.
Key Difference:

Absolute: Consistent, location-independent.
Relative: Shorter, depends on the fileâ€™s location.
